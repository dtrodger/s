				<h1>Photo Classes</h1>
				<p>What to do with all those buttons? This course helps you understand how to use the settings on a DSLR to create great images. The transition from a point and shoot or phone to high level camera is exciting and can be intimidating. The quality of image that you can get is amazing but the hundreds of settings can get in the way if you don’t know how to use them. When you finish this course you will be up and running and creating amazing photos. (1-3 hour evening session - $75.00)</p>
